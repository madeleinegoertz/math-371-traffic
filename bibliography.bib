By statistical analysis of traffic data from the UK motorway network, we find that the functional form preferred for this does not have an explicit jam density that will induce zero speed in traffic. We deduce that it is zero speed that induces jam density in traffic rather than vice versa, so that the direction of causality between speed and density differs according to circumstances. We develop an approach to modelling traffic in light of this. We apply this to analyse speed control as a traffic management measure and show how it can be used to estimate the effect of speed management on road capacity.},

  abstract = {Accelerations and braking are needed in traffic to allow a vehicle to travel from one place to another. Also present during the drive are lateral accelerations, which are active in curves. The accelerations and braking active during the drive are usually in the range of one fifth to one third of maximum value. In critical and unexpected situations, the accelerations and braking are increased up to maximum values. Maximum values of acceleration and braking depend on roughness of ground, type of ground, quality of tires, quality of vehicle brakes, etc. Because of critical and unexpected situations, there are many accidents on the roads. In these cases, accelerations or braking reach their limit values and many times the vehicle becomes uncontrollable. In this paper the system for measurement and analyses of accelerations and braking in traffic of vehicles is presented. These systems are necessary for analyses of different accidents in traffic and to define maximal longitudinal accelerations, maximal lateral accelerations and maximal braking in different situations. Also presented in this article are practical measurements and analyses of maximal accelerations and braking for selected cars, which were measured on a straight road, and comparisons of these measurements with the producer data and accelerations and braking measured on a racetrack.},

Both the utility of a given lane and the risk associated with lane changes are determined in terms of longitudinal accelerations calculated with microscopic traffic models. This determination allows for the formulation of compact and general safety and incentive criteria for both symmetric and asymmetric passing rules. Moreover, anticipative elements and the crucial influence of velocity differences of these car-following models are automatically transferred to the lane-changing rules. Although the safety criterion prevents critical lane changes and collisions, the incentive criterion takes into account the advantages and disadvantages of other drivers associated with a lane change via the "politeness factor." The parameter allows one to vary the motivation for lane changing from purely egoistic to more cooperative driving behavior. This novel feature allows one first to prevent lane changes for a marginal advantage if they obstruct other drivers and second to let an aggressive driver induce the lane change of a slower driver ahead in order to no longer be obstructed. This phenomenon is common for asymmetric passing rules with a dedicated lane for passing. The model is applied to traffic simulations of cars and trucks with the intelligent driver model as the underlying car-following model. An open system with an on-ramp is studied, and the resulting lane-changing rate is investigated as a function of the spatial coordinate as well as a function of traffic density.},

  abstract = {Traffic models based on cellular automata have high computational efficiency because of their simplicity in describing unrealistic vehicular behavior and the versatility of cellular automata to be implemented on parallel processing. On the other hand, the other microscopic traffic models such as car-following models are computationally more expensive, but they have more realistic driver behaviors and detailed vehicle characteristics. We propose a new class between these two categories, defining a traffic model based on continuous cellular automata where we combine the efficiency of cellular automata models with the accuracy of the other microscopic models. More precisely, we introduce a stochastic cellular automata traffic model in which the space is not coarse-grain but continuous. The continuity also allows us to embed a multi-agent fuzzy system proposed to handle uncertainties in decision making on road traffic. Therefore, we simulate different driver behaviors and study the effect of various compositions of vehicles within the traffic stream from the macroscopic point of view. The experimental results show that our model is able to reproduce the typical traffic flow phenomena showing a variety of effects due to the heterogeneity of traffic.},

The states are localized or extended, homogeneous or oscillating. Combined states are observed as well, like the coexistence of moving localized clusters and clusters pinned at road inhomogeneities, or regions of oscillating congested traffic upstream of nearly homogeneous congested traffic. The experimental findings are consistent with a recently proposed theoretical phase diagram for traffic near on-ramps [D. Helbing, A. Hennecke, and M. Treiber, Phys. Rev. Lett. \{\textbackslash bf 82\}, 4360 (1999)]. We simulate these situations with a novel continuous microscopic single-lane model, the ``intelligent driver model'' (IDM), using the empirical boundary conditions. All observations, including the coexistence of states, are qualitatively reproduced by describing inhomogeneities with local variations of one model parameter. We show that the results of the microscopic model can be understood by formulating the theoretical phase diagram for bottlenecks in a more general way. In particular, a local drop of the road capacity induced by parameter variations has practically the same effect as an on-ramp.},
